# PEP-053: Always-On Specialization — Remove the Explicit `specialize` Surface and Static Builtins

**Status:** Draft (2026-07-02)
**Date:** 2026-07-02
**Author:** Claude (with Dean Povey)
**Absorbs:** [PEP-052](PEP-052-import-scoped-macro-activation.md) Phase D (the "inlining registry" phase)
**Relates to:** [PEP-004](PEP-004-source-based-typeclass-features.md) (source-based typeclass features), [PEP-032](PEP-032-macro-expansion-import-emission.md) (self-contained expansions)

## Summary

Specialization (zero-cost inlining of typeclass dictionary methods at call sites)
becomes a **transparent, always-on compiler optimization** — not an API. This PEP:

1. **Deletes the explicit specialization surface**: the `specialize()`,
   `specialize$`, `mono()`, and `inlineCall()` macros, the `fn.specialize(dict)`
   extension-method rewrite, the `Specialized<F, N>` type, and the
   `@typesugar/specialize` package.
2. **Deletes the ~30 hard-coded `registerInstanceMethods(...)` builtins** (the
   static source-string tables for fp/std/effect instances) after upgrading
   AST source extraction to cover everything they covered.
3. **Unifies the specialization pipeline**, which today exists as two
   independently maintained near-verbatim copies (`packages/transformer` and
   `packages/transformer-core`).
4. **Keeps the `@no-specialize` opt-out** (and fixes its broken
   `@no-specialize-warn` sibling).

Auto-specialization already runs on every call expression by default — there is
no config toggle, and there never was. What stops it from being _the_ mechanism
is coverage (gated by the hard-coded builtin list), a crutch API (the explicit
macros, which the warnings themselves advertise), and duplication (two pipelines
that can silently diverge). This PEP removes all three, once and for all.

## Motivation — why isn't specialization "just the default" already?

It nearly is. `tryAutoSpecialize` runs unconditionally in both transformers on
every `CallExpression`; the only gates are the generic PEP-052 scope opt-out,
the `@no-specialize` comment, and — the real limiter — **instance recognition**:
an argument specializes only if its method bodies are known, either from

- `tryExtractInstanceFromSource` (AST extraction from the instance's
  declaration), or
- the `instanceMethodRegistry` — whose static entries are ~30 hand-maintained
  `registerInstanceMethods("arrayFunctor", "Array", { map: { source: "(fa, f) => fa.map(f)", ... } })`
  calls: **source-code-as-strings, shipped inside the compiler**, duplicating
  (and drifting from) the real instances in `@typesugar/fp`, `/std`, `/effect`.

That design has three compounding problems:

1. **The builtin table is a lie waiting to happen.** The strings are copies of
   library code. Some already disagree with the source (`flatMapEffect` inlines
   `Effect.map` while the source calls `getEffectModule().map`); two entries
   (`eitherBifunctor`, `flatMapStream`) have **no corresponding source instance
   at all**. Third-party instances can never be in the table, so builtins get
   magic behavior users can't replicate — exactly the "no hardcoded magic"
   principle PEP-052 Part 3 established for operators.
2. **The explicit macros exist because auto-coverage is unreliable.** Every
   TS9602 skip warning says "Use explicit specialize() if you need guaranteed
   inlining" — the escape hatch is load-bearing precisely because the default
   path has gaps. Close the gaps and the escape hatch is pure surface area:
   four macros, a package, a runtime-stub family, an extension-method rewrite,
   and a 10-arity type utility, all teaching users to hand-annotate an
   optimization the compiler should just do. (Rust doesn't have a
   `monomorphize!()` macro.)
3. **Two pipelines.** The production path (ts-patch / unplugin / CLI / LSP /
   `api/compile.ts`) runs a private-method clone in `packages/transformer`
   (~lines 3015–3651); the playground runs the free functions in
   `packages/transformer-core/src/specialization.ts`. Same gates, same
   diagnostics, maintained in parallel — and already divergent (see §Capability
   work, item 5).

Since typesugar is pre-release with no consumers, we take the correct fix, not
the compatible one.

## Design principles

- **Specialization is an optimization, not a feature you call.** There is no
  user-facing API to request it and no config to enable it. If the compiler can
  prove the inlining is sound, it does it; if not, dictionary passing remains —
  which is always semantically correct.
- **Source is the single source of truth for instance bodies.** Method
  implementations come from the instance declaration's AST (same-file or
  imported), never from shipped string tables. What works for user instances is
  exactly what works for std/fp/effect instances — no builtin magic.
- **Opt-out, not opt-in.** `// @no-specialize` on the call line disables it.
  This is the one piece of explicit surface that stays (spelled as today;
  Julia's `@nospecialize` is the same idea).
- **Failure to specialize is never an error.** The fallback is the code you
  wrote. Skip diagnostics remain warnings (TS9602), reworded to explain the
  blocker in the function body — not to advertise a deleted macro.
- **Primitive intrinsics are not cruft.** `eqNumber` inlining to `a === b`
  (rather than a call into the source `Eq<number>` instance) is genuinely
  compiler knowledge with no source-level representation. The 16
  `primitiveIntrinsicRegistry` entries stay.

## What is removed

Explicitly **in** scope for deletion alongside `specialize()`: `mono()` and
`inlineCall()`. Both are same-family sugar with near-zero usage outside the
specialize package's own examples; keeping them would preserve the "annotate
your optimizations" model this PEP removes. (Decision point flagged below.)

## What stays

- The **auto-specialization pipeline**: `tryAutoSpecialize`,
  `tryReturnTypeDrivenSpecialize` (Result-algebra), hoisting
  (`createHoistedSpecialization`, `SpecializationCache`), DCE scanning.
- The **`instanceMethodRegistry` Map itself** — as a per-program **AST cache**,
  populated only by `registerInstanceMethodsFromAST` (written by the
  `@instance`/`@impl` macros and by `tryExtractInstanceFromSource` as a
  write-back cache). The _static seeding_ is what dies, not the mechanism.
- The **16 primitive intrinsics** (`primitiveIntrinsicRegistry`) and
  `getInstanceOrIntrinsicMethods`, which `recursivelyInlineInstanceCalls` and
  `tryInlineDerivedInstanceCall` depend on for nested native-operator inlining.
- The **`@no-specialize` opt-out** (see §Opt-out semantics).
- **Out of scope**: `@typesugar/effect`'s `specializeSchema` (a distinct Effect
  Schema feature that shares only the name) and `@typesugar/sql`'s local
  `registerInstanceMethods` (`sql/src/meta.ts:44` — a name-matched runtime
  stub, not the macros registry).

Audit note: `createSpecializedFunction` is today shared by the explicit macro,
the `fn.specialize()` extension, and parts of hoisting. After Wave 1 its
liveness must be re-checked — keep whatever the auto path still uses, delete
the rest.

## Capability work — closing the gaps the builtins papered over

The gap analysis of `tryExtractInstanceFromSource` against the 30 builtins
found five concrete deficiencies. All must land (with tests) **before** the
builtins are deleted:

1. **Cross-module alias resolution.** Extraction calls `getSymbolAtLocation` →
   `getDeclarations()` without `getAliasedSymbol`, so an **imported** instance
   resolves to its `ImportSpecifier` and extraction bails. Since every builtin
   instance lives in a different package from user call sites, this single gap
   makes the whole builtin table load-bearing. Fix: follow import aliases to
   the original `VariableDeclaration`.
2. **Function-form / factory instances.** `eitherFunctor<E>()`,
   `effectFunctor`, `effectMonad`, `effectEitherMonad` are factories
   (`const eitherFunctor = <E>() => ({ ... })`). Today `getInstanceName`
   rejects `CallExpression` args and extraction requires an object-literal
   initializer. Fix: accept a call-of-identifier arg; resolve the factory; if
   its body is (or trivially returns) an object literal, extract from that.
3. **Identifier-alias consts.** `export const stdFlatMapArray = flatMapArray`
   (`std/src/specialize/index.ts:64+`) — chase identifier initializers to the
   aliased declaration.
4. **Property-access members.** `map: optionFunctor.map`
   (`fp/src/instances.ts:277`) is skipped by `extractMethodsFromObjectLiteral`.
   Fix: resolve the referenced instance and splice in that method.
5. **Unify extraction criteria.** transformer-core requires an `@impl`/
   `@instance` JSDoc tag; the legacy transformer accepts `@impl` **or** a
   typeclass type annotation (`const x: Functor<F> = {...}`). Adopt the looser
   rule (annotation suffices) everywhere — several std/effect instances
   (`flatMap*`, `chunkFunctor`, `effectOptionMonad`) carry only annotations.

Known semantic caveats to resolve during migration (not blockers, but each
needs an explicit decision + test):

- `flatMapIterable`/`flatMapAsyncIterable` source bodies call module-local
  helpers (`iterableMap`) — inlining them captures free identifiers. Either
  rely on PEP-032 import emission for hoisted specializations, or let these
  fall back to dictionary passing (acceptable: fallback is always correct).
- `flatMapEffect`'s builtin inlined `Effect.map` but the source calls
  `getEffectModule().map` — the **source** behavior wins by definition; verify
  the effect benchmarks still pass.
- `eitherBifunctor` and `flatMapStream` have **no source instance**: author
  them in fp/effect if anything exercises them, otherwise they are already
  dead and simply vanish with the table.
- `optionMonad`'s builtin shipped an inline `map`; post-migration it comes via
  gap-fix 4.

## Pipeline unification

One implementation, two consumers. `packages/transformer`'s private-method
clone (`tryAutoSpecialize`, `tryExtractInstanceFromSource`,
`inlineAutoSpecializeForHoisting`, `tryReturnTypeDrivenSpecialize`,
`tryInlineDerivedInstanceCall`, `rewriteDictCallsForAutoSpec`,
`specializeForResultAlgebra`, ~lines 3015–3651) is deleted in favor of the
free functions in `transformer-core/src/specialization.ts` (which already take
a context parameter). The main risk is the context-type mismatch between the
two transformers' `MacroContext` implementations — the wave starts with an
interface audit; if full unification stalls, the fallback is a shared module
both import (what `position-mapper.ts` already does), never two copies.

## Opt-out semantics (kept, fixed)

- `// @no-specialize` on the call line disables specialization for that call.
  Spelling unchanged.
- **Bug fix:** the check is a raw substring scan and `"@no-specialize-warn"`
  _contains_ `"@no-specialize"`, so the bail branch fires first and
  `@no-specialize-warn` today disables specialization entirely instead of
  suppressing warnings. Fix with exact-token matching. Decide whether
  `-warn` survives at all — with TS9602 reworded and rate-limited it may be
  unnecessary (recommended: keep it; silencing a per-call warning without
  changing semantics is a legitimate need).
- **Doc/impl mismatch:** docs show the marker on the line above the call;
  the implementation scans only the same line before the call start. Extend
  the scan to the immediately preceding comment line so both documented forms
  work, and add tests for each.
- The generic PEP-052 scope opt-outs (`@ts-no-typesugar macros`,
  `"use no typesugar"`) continue to imply no specialization — unchanged.

## Waves

- **Wave 1 — delete the explicit surface.** Everything in §What is removed
  except the builtin table: the four macros + registrations, runtime stubs,
  `fn.specialize()` rewrite (both copies), the `@typesugar/specialize` package
  (+ manifest/loader/typesugar wiring, dry-run example deps), TS9601, TS9602
  rewording (drop "Use explicit specialize()"; point at the body blocker /
  `@no-specialize-warn`), the `@no-specialize`/`-warn` matching bug + doc
  mismatch. Rewrite/delete dependent tests (`tests/red-team-specialize.test.ts`,
  `packages/transformer/tests/specialize-extension.test.ts`, package suites)
  and examples. Audit `createSpecializedFunction` liveness. _This wave also
  removes the only registry consumers with no source fallback (the explicit
  macros read `instanceMethodRegistry` directly), simplifying Wave 4._
- **Wave 2 — source-extraction capability.** Gap fixes 1–5 with a test per
  former builtin proving its source instance is extractable (imported, aliased,
  factory-form, property-access member), in both pipelines while they still
  exist.
- **Wave 3 — pipeline unification.** Legacy transformer consumes
  transformer-core's specialization module; delete the clone. Full suite +
  LSP/vscode + playground gates.
- **Wave 4 — delete the static builtins.** Remove the 30
  `registerInstanceMethods` calls, the function itself, and the
  internal-registration machinery; author-or-drop `eitherBifunctor`/
  `flatMapStream`; keep primitives + AST cache. Gates: full suite,
  `pnpm bench` (zero-cost benchmarks must still show inlined output — this is
  the regression detector for extraction coverage), playground examples.
- **Wave 5 — docs sweep.** Rewrite `docs/guides/specialize.md` as the
  auto-specialization guide (how it works, what blocks inlining, the opt-out);
  update `docs/reference/packages.md`, `docs/macro-triggers.md`,
  `docs/guides/error-messages.md` (TS9601 section removed, TS9602 documented),
  README/docs package tables, sidebar nav, and the secondary guide mentions
  (typeclasses/fp/validate/opt-out/developer-experience/architecture).

Invariant (as in PEP-052): the builtin table stays populated until Wave 4's
gates prove source extraction covers it — no wave leaves the build, LSP, or
playground with regressed inlining.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `grep -r "specialize(" --include="*.ts"` in user-facing code finds no
   explicit-macro calls; `@typesugar/specialize` no longer exists;
   `specializeMacro` et al. are gone from the registry, manifests, and loader.
2. Zero `registerInstanceMethods(` call sites (the sql-local stub excepted);
   the only registry writers are `registerInstanceMethodsFromAST` call sites.
3. An imported, `@impl`-tagged (or typeclass-annotated) object-literal,
   factory-form, or aliased instance from another package specializes at a
   user call site — each form covered by a test.
4. Exactly one specialization pipeline implementation is compiled into the
   repo (transformer imports it from transformer-core or a shared module).
5. `// @no-specialize` disables; `// @no-specialize-warn` suppresses warnings
   without disabling; both work same-line and preceding-line; tests cover all
   four cases.
6. `pnpm bench` zero-cost numbers are within noise of pre-PEP
   `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` values; benchmark output assertions confirm inlining
   still occurs for the former-builtin instances exercised there.
7. No TS9601 references remain; TS9602 messages do not mention removed API.
8. Full suite, typecheck, `check:skips`, playground examples green.

## Decisions & open questions

- **DECIDED (Dean, 2026-07-02):** no explicit `specialize()` macro; keep the
  `@no-specialize` opt-out.
- **Recommended, needs confirmation:** `mono()` and `inlineCall()` go too
  (same family, near-zero usage). Cost of keeping: two macros + stubs + docs
  that contradict "specialization is not an API".
- **Recommended:** keep `@no-specialize-warn` (fixed), since TS9602 remains
  the only feedback channel for "why didn't this inline".
- **Open:** whether hoisted specializations that need free identifiers
  (module-local helpers in instance bodies) use PEP-032 import emission or
  just fall back — decide in Wave 2 with the `flatMapIterable` case in front
  of us.
