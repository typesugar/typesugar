# @typesugar/transformer-core

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d8f810b: PEP-052 Wave 2: labeled-block macros are now import-scoped (`@syntax-labels`
  activation), matching the operator/method syntax gates.
  - BREAKING (pre-1.0): `let:`/`seq:`/`par:`/`all:` do-notation comprehensions
    only expand in files that import `@typesugar/std/syntax/do`, and bare
    `requires:`/`ensures:` contract blocks only apply `@contract` in files that
    import `@typesugar/contracts/syntax`. The explicit `@contract` decorator form
    is unaffected (importing the symbol is the opt-in).
  - NEW: TS9224 warning when a block-shaped label matches a registered macro
    whose syntax is not activated, with a help hint naming the exact import to
    add (unexpanded do-notation is still valid JS — `x << effect()` silently
    becomes a bit-shift — so the hint matters).
  - NEW: `@syntax-labels <macroName>` activation-marker tag (read alongside
    `@syntax-operators`/`@syntax-methods`) and an optional `syntaxModule` field
    on `LabeledBlockMacro`/`AttributeMacro` that feeds the TS9224 hint and
    doubles as a resolution-free activation fallback — an import specifier
    exactly matching a macro's `syntaxModule` activates it even in hosts that
    cannot resolve modules (the playground's in-memory host, virtual file
    names).
  - FIXED: ordinary loop labels colliding with macro label names
    (`all: for (…)`) were dispatched to the macro (a hard error) when the file
    had the syntax activated; labeled non-blocks are no longer dispatch
    candidates at all.
  - FIXED: an expression-position comprehension in a file that never activates
    do-notation was text-rewritten by the preprocessor and then left mangled
    (invalid JS) by the gate; the preprocessor is now gated on activation too,
    leaving such files untouched.
  - FIXED: activation markers (all kinds, operators/methods included) were
    silently dropped in files rewritten by the expression-comprehension
    preprocessor — the re-parsed file isn't part of the `ts.Program`, so
    checker-based marker resolution failed. Markers now resolve against the
    program's own copy of the file.

- e274769: PEP-052 Wave 8: unified the two pipelines' JSDoc/decorator macro dispatch —
  `@typesugar/transformer` now delegates to `@typesugar/transformer-core`'s
  shared implementation instead of keeping its own ~875-line copy.
  - FIXED: `@typesugar/transformer-core` silently ignored `@deriving`/`@derive`
    JSDoc tags ("unknown JSDoc macro tag" warning) and silently no-op'd real
    `@derive(...)` decorators — PEP-032 deleted the standalone `derive`
    attribute macro, and neither of transformer-core's dispatchers had the
    special case routing it to the real derive registry instead. Both fixed.
    `@adt` is now recognized as a JSDoc tag too (it was missing from the tag
    map entirely).
  - FIXED (transformer-core only, found while porting): `expandDeriveDecorator`
    was missing the `TS9101`/`TS9103`/`TS9104` diagnostic checks (non-derivable
    field types, union without discriminant, empty types) and source-map
    preservation for derive-generated statements that `@typesugar/transformer`
    already had. `extractTypeInfo` was missing a method/accessor skip check,
    so it could incorrectly count a class's methods as derivable data fields.
    Both ported into the shared implementation.
  - REMOVED: `@typesugar/transformer`'s private copies of the JSDoc tag map,
    dispatcher, decorator parsing/sorting, and derive-expansion logic — all
    now delegate to `@typesugar/transformer-core`.

- 053978c: PEP-053 Wave 1: specialization is now an always-on compiler optimization, not
  an API.
  - REMOVED: the `specialize()`, `specialize$()`, `mono()`, and `inlineCall()`
    macros and runtime stubs, the `fn.specialize(dict)` extension-method rewrite,
    and the `@typesugar/specialize` package (including the `Specialized<F, N>`
    type). Calls that pass a known typeclass instance auto-specialize — no
    annotation needed; use `// @no-specialize` to opt a call out.
  - REMOVED: `createSpecializedFunction`, `canFlattenToExpression`, and the
    `SpecializeOptions` type from `@typesugar/macros` (dead once the explicit
    surface was gone), and the TS9601/TS9221 diagnostics.
  - FIXED: `// @no-specialize-warn` previously disabled specialization entirely
    (substring collision with `// @no-specialize`); it now only suppresses the
    TS9602 skip warning. Both markers now also work on a comment line
    immediately above the call, matching the documented form.

- 8aaf40f: PEP-053 Wave 2: source-based instance extraction now covers everything the
  static builtin table covered. Auto-specialization recognizes instances across
  import aliases (including renames), identifier-alias consts
  (`const stdFlatMapArray = flatMapArray`), zero-arg factory instances
  (`eitherFunctor<E>()`), indirect object-literal members
  (`map: optionFunctor.map`, shorthand `{ map }`), and companion paths
  (`Point.Numeric`). Acceptance criteria are unified across both pipelines:
  an `@impl`/`@instance` tag OR a typeclass-shaped type annotation suffices.

  Cross-module method bodies that reference the instance module's local helpers
  or imports are NOT inlined — those calls fall back to dictionary passing
  (always correct) instead of capturing dangling identifiers.

  The extraction implementation is now shared (`@typesugar/macros`
  instance-extraction module) and consumed by both the legacy transformer and
  transformer-core, replacing the duplicated per-pipeline copies. New
  `cloneNodeDeep` utility in `@typesugar/core` protects foreign-file ASTs from
  in-place position stripping during inlining.

- 855eb1f: PEP-053 Wave 3: one specialization pipeline. The legacy transformer's private
  clone of the specialization pass (~700 lines) is deleted in favor of the
  shared implementation in `@typesugar/transformer-core`, now exported from its
  package index. Production paths (ts-patch, unplugin, CLI, LSP) and the
  playground run the same code.

  Unification deltas (all in the direction of correctness): hoisted
  specializations of generic functions no longer carry parameter type
  annotations that reference stripped type parameters; void-returning functions
  no longer emit a spurious `[TS9602] no return statement` skip warning; inlined
  derived-instance calls strip comment trivia in both pipelines (previously
  legacy-only).

### Patch Changes

- 63bf193: PEP-052 Wave 3: do-notation instance resolution is scope-based — the last
  process-global instance registry is deleted.
  - BREAKING (pre-1.0): `let:`/`par:` comprehensions resolve their
    `FlatMap`/`ParCombine` instance from the file's scope (a local `@impl`
    declaration or an export of any imported module), not from a global
    registry populated by side-effect imports elsewhere in the program. The
    std builtins (Array, Promise, Iterable, AsyncIterable) ride along with the
    `@typesugar/std/syntax/do` marker every do-notation file already imports —
    zero new imports for the common case. Effect users import
    `@typesugar/effect/syntax/do` (one line: activates the labels AND provides
    the Effect instances).
  - NEW: TS9225 "No FlatMap instance for 'X' is in scope" error naming the
    exact import to add when resolution misses.
  - NEW: `@do-methods` JSDoc metadata on instances declares do-notation
    emission (bind/map/orElse method names, static-vs-method call style,
    static receiver, `all` join) — replacing the hardcoded Promise/Effect
    special cases in the comprehension macros. Third-party monads get the
    same treatment as std's.
  - NEW: scanner-visible `FlatMap<Either>` instance (`flatMapEitherInstance`)
    in `@typesugar/fp` — `let:` over Either now works via any fp import (the
    `flatMapEither<E>()` factory alone was never discoverable, so Either
    do-notation had silently never expanded).
  - NEW: `ParCombine<Effect>` instance — `par:` over Effect now emits
    `Effect.map(Effect.all([...]), ...)`; previously it fell back to an
    applicative chain emitting `.map(...).ap(...)` calls Effect doesn't have.
  - REMOVED: `doNotationRegistry`, `parCombineBuilderRegistry`, and their API
    (`registerFlatMap`, `registerParCombine`, `registerParCombineBuilder`,
    `getFlatMapMethodNames`, `hasFlatMapInstance`, `hasParCombineInstance`,
    `getInstanceMeta`, `clearRegistries`). Declare instances with `@impl` +
    `@do-methods` and export them instead.

- 98adbea: PEP-052 Wave 4: de-magicking — HKT typeclass knowledge is
  declaration-derived and the dead post-registry surfaces are gone.
  - REMOVED: `hktTypeclassNames`, `registerHKTTypeclass`, the
    `hktExpansionRegistry` hardcoded seeds, and the hand-written HKT signature
    templates. `isHKTTypeclass` now derives from the `@typeclass` interface
    declaration (type parameter used as `Kind<F,…>`, including through
    `extends` chains — the op-index flattens heritage). fp's typeclass
    interfaces (Functor…Alternative) now carry `@typeclass` tags and are read
    exactly like third-party typeclasses.
  - REMOVED: the `InstanceMeta` type, all no-op 1-arg
    `registerInstanceWithMeta` calls, the legacy transformer's import
    pre-scan, the dead `knownTypeclasses` scope chain
    (`isTypeclassInScope`/`getInScopeTypeclasses`/`registerImportedTypeclass`),
    the test-only ResultAlgebra helpers
    (`unsafeResultAlgebra`/`hasResultAlgebra`/`getAllResultAlgebras`), and
    `register-instances.ts` (`registerStdInstances` survives as a deprecated
    runtime no-op stub).
  - NEW: `@do-instance-module <specifier>` JSDoc tag — do-notation instance
    providers self-describe their activation import; the TS9225 hint consults a
    program-wide index first and falls back to a small static table only for
    providers whose declaration files are unreachable in the program.
