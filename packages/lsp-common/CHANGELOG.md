# @typesugar/lsp-common

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 89c895b: Package descriptions: the umbrella package uses the project tagline;
  `@typesugar/typeclass` no longer claims auto-derivation (instances come from
  `@derive` and `derived()`); `@typesugar/derive` says it is the `@derive` macros;
  `@typesugar/lsp-common` describes the language-service helpers it holds, not the
  removed LSP server.
- 4f6ad83: PEP-034: Unified SFINAE registration and shared IDE infrastructure
  - Unified all SFINAE rule registration into `registerAllSfinaeRules()` to prevent drift between IDE paths
  - New `@typesugar/lsp-common` package with shared position mapping, AST helpers, and macro code actions
  - Added `getApplicableRefactors` and `getCompletionEntryDetails` to the TS plugin language service
  - Diagnostic parity test suite exercising all 6 SFINAE rules
  - Zed extension workspace detection (only starts LSP for typesugar projects)

- ab72bde: PEP-058 Wave 1: declare `engines.node >=20` on all published packages and enable npm provenance attestations in the release pipeline.
- a252187: PEP-058 Wave 2: pre-release onboarding and source corrections.
  - `typesugar init` now actually patches an existing vite/webpack/rollup
    config (previously it computed and silently discarded the patch,
    no-oping in the most common brownfield case), and prints an explicit
    "not yet supported" message for Next.js instead of implying support.
  - `typesugar create` templates now ship inside `@typesugar/transformer` —
    previously they lived only at the monorepo root, so `create` failed for
    every registry install of the CLI.
  - `typesugar doctor`'s ts-patch detection now checks for ts-patch's real
    `/// tsp-module:` header instead of a fuzzy substring that could
    false-positive on unpatched builds.
  - All compiler-emitted diagnostic help URLs (`seeAlso` in the TS9xxx and
    EFFECT0xx catalogs) and CLI next-step links now point at the canonical
    typesugar.org domain (previously typesugar.dev, which is not the site).
  - `@typesugar/lsp-common` gains a README and `sideEffects: false`.

- 56e1acf: Editor position fixes in the TypeScript plugin, for files whose macros expand:
  - Go-to-definition (and go-to-implementation) lands on the right line after a `@derive` or other
    expansion that adds lines above the target. tsserver converts the result to line/column with
    the language service's `toLineColumnOffset`, which read the expanded code; the plugin now
    converts on the source text.
  - TypeScript's quick fixes are offered in expanded files, with their edits on the source text.
    The error's span is mapped into the expanded code, and a fix that would edit generated code is
    not offered. "Fix all" (combined code fixes) is mapped the same way.
  - TypeScript's own inlay hints are shown when the requested span starts or ends in a comment
    (as a whole-file request always does): the span is mapped as a range.
  - Rename, find-references and document highlights no longer return locations in generated code.
    A `@derive` companion's references to the type were mapped onto the `@derive` tag, so renaming
    the type would have edited "@de" of the comment five times. A location is kept only when it is
    the same text in the source.
  - A file the transform leaves unchanged maps positions by identity.

  `@typesugar/lsp-common` adds `mapSourceSpanToOriginal` (a span that must be the user's own text)
  and `mapTextSpanToTransformed` (a request span mapped as a range). Position-to-line lookups in
  the `@typesugar/transformer-core` position mapper are now a binary search.

- 93ea406: PEP-060 item 1: support TypeScript 6, reject TypeScript 7 with one clear error
  - **Peer range is now `typescript >=5.9.0 <7.0.0`** on every package (was
    `>=5.0.0 <6.0.0`). TypeScript 6.0.x still has the JavaScript compiler API typesugar
    is built on; TypeScript 7 (`typescript@latest` since 7.0) does not. The floor
    moved up from 5.0 because older releases were measured to break: before 5.5,
    Node's ESM loader sees none of TypeScript's named exports, so the CLI and the
    Vite plugin crash on their first `ts.*` access (5.0–5.3 also lack
    `checker.isTypeAssignableTo` and other APIs typesugar calls); 5.5–5.8 lack
    `checker.getNonPrimitiveType()`, so `@impl X<object>` instances never resolve.
    5.9.3 and 6.0.3 build, type-check and pass the core, transformer-core, macros,
    transformer, std and fp suites. The `library` and `macro-plugin` templates that
    `typesugar create` copies peer the same range, and all three templates now
    install `typescript ^5.9.3`.
  - **`typescript` is now an optional peer** of the packages whose runtime `.` entry
    never loads it: codec, collections, contracts, erased, fp, fusion, mapper, parser,
    strings, testing, units, validate and the `typesugar` umbrella. Their `./macros`
    entries still need TypeScript at build time. `check:runtime-purity` now fails if a
    package with an optional peer loads `typescript` from its `.` entry, directly or
    through a dependency.
  - **TypeScript version guard.** `@typesugar/core` exports `assertSupportedTypeScript`,
    `getUnsupportedTypeScriptReason`, `UnsupportedTypeScriptError`,
    `SUPPORTED_TYPESCRIPT_RANGE` and `TYPESCRIPT_SUPPORT_URL`. `@typesugar/macros` runs
    it first thing at load, and the transformer (pipeline, ts-patch factory, and the
    language-service plugin, which checks tsserver's own TypeScript), `transformCode`,
    unplugin, the LSP server and the ESLint processors call it before their first
    compiler-API access. On TypeScript 7 they all stop with
    `[typesugar] TypeScript 7.0.2 is not supported: TypeScript 7 removed the JavaScript
compiler API that typesugar's transformer needs. Install typescript@6 (or 5.9+) as a
devDependency for typesugar (npm i -D typescript@6); see
https://typesugar.org/getting-started/troubleshooting#typescript-7` instead of an
    opaque `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ES2022')`. TypeScript older
    than 5.9, or a module missing `ts.factory` / `ts.createProgram`, is rejected the
    same way.
