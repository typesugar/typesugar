# @typesugar/fp

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 98adbea: PEP-052 Wave 4: de-magicking — HKT typeclass knowledge is
  declaration-derived and the dead post-registry surfaces are gone.
  - REMOVED: `hktTypeclassNames`, `registerHKTTypeclass`, the
    `hktExpansionRegistry` hardcoded seeds, and the hand-written HKT signature
    templates. `isHKTTypeclass` now derives from the `@typeclass` interface
    declaration (type parameter used as `Kind<F,…>`, including through
    `extends` chains — the op-index flattens heritage). fp's typeclass
    interfaces (Functor…Alternative) now carry `@typeclass` tags and are read
    exactly like third-party typeclasses.
  - REMOVED: the `InstanceMeta` type, all no-op 1-arg
    `registerInstanceWithMeta` calls, the legacy transformer's import
    pre-scan, the dead `knownTypeclasses` scope chain
    (`isTypeclassInScope`/`getInScopeTypeclasses`/`registerImportedTypeclass`),
    the test-only ResultAlgebra helpers
    (`unsafeResultAlgebra`/`hasResultAlgebra`/`getAllResultAlgebras`), and
    `register-instances.ts` (`registerStdInstances` survives as a deprecated
    runtime no-op stub).
  - NEW: `@do-instance-module <specifier>` JSDoc tag — do-notation instance
    providers self-describe their activation import; the TS9225 hint consults a
    program-wide index first and falls back to a small static table only for
    providers whose declaration files are unreachable in the program.

- 48b621b: PEP-052 Wave 5: `Show` method-sugar activation, and a latent
  `resolveTypeString` bug fix.
  - NEW: `Show`'s interface now carries `@typeclass`, and a new
    `@typesugar/fp/syntax/show` marker (`@syntax-methods Show`) activates
    `.show()` method sugar — mirroring how Eq/Ord's method syntax is gated.
    `Show` has no operator form, so there is only one activation tier.
  - FIXED: `resolveTypeString` (used by the instance scanner to resolve
    `@impl <TC><Type>` type strings) silently resolved the `symbol`/`unknown`/
    `object` keyword types to `any` on some `ts.TypeChecker` configurations
    (an unbound synthetic node quirk), which — because `any` is bidirectionally
    assignable to/from everything — could make two unrelated instances
    (e.g. `@impl Show<symbol>` and `@impl Show<number>`) spuriously report as
    "ambiguous" for every other type. Every keyword type string now resolves
    through the checker's internal intrinsic getter (`getESSymbolType`,
    `getUnknownType`, `getNonPrimitiveType`, etc.) instead of an unbound
    synthetic node, and the fallback path is hardened so any keyword resolving
    to `any` (other than `any` itself) is treated as unresolvable rather than
    silently wrong.
  - FIXED: `@typesugar/fp`'s `package.json` had `"sideEffects": false`, which
    could let an aggressive bundler drop the new marker's bare side-effect
    import. Flipped to `true`, matching `@typesugar/std`'s existing markers.

### Patch Changes

- 63bf193: PEP-052 Wave 3: do-notation instance resolution is scope-based — the last
  process-global instance registry is deleted.
  - BREAKING (pre-1.0): `let:`/`par:` comprehensions resolve their
    `FlatMap`/`ParCombine` instance from the file's scope (a local `@impl`
    declaration or an export of any imported module), not from a global
    registry populated by side-effect imports elsewhere in the program. The
    std builtins (Array, Promise, Iterable, AsyncIterable) ride along with the
    `@typesugar/std/syntax/do` marker every do-notation file already imports —
    zero new imports for the common case. Effect users import
    `@typesugar/effect/syntax/do` (one line: activates the labels AND provides
    the Effect instances).
  - NEW: TS9225 "No FlatMap instance for 'X' is in scope" error naming the
    exact import to add when resolution misses.
  - NEW: `@do-methods` JSDoc metadata on instances declares do-notation
    emission (bind/map/orElse method names, static-vs-method call style,
    static receiver, `all` join) — replacing the hardcoded Promise/Effect
    special cases in the comprehension macros. Third-party monads get the
    same treatment as std's.
  - NEW: scanner-visible `FlatMap<Either>` instance (`flatMapEitherInstance`)
    in `@typesugar/fp` — `let:` over Either now works via any fp import (the
    `flatMapEither<E>()` factory alone was never discoverable, so Either
    do-notation had silently never expanded).
  - NEW: `ParCombine<Effect>` instance — `par:` over Effect now emits
    `Effect.map(Effect.all([...]), ...)`; previously it fell back to an
    applicative chain emitting `.map(...).ap(...)` calls Effect doesn't have.
  - REMOVED: `doNotationRegistry`, `parCombineBuilderRegistry`, and their API
    (`registerFlatMap`, `registerParCombine`, `registerParCombineBuilder`,
    `getFlatMapMethodNames`, `hasFlatMapInstance`, `hasParCombineInstance`,
    `getInstanceMeta`, `clearRegistries`). Declare instances with `@impl` +
    `@do-methods` and export them instead.

- 563e46b: PEP-052 Wave 6: resolution-free operator/method syntax-marker fallback,
  closing the gap for hosts (the browser playground) that cannot resolve
  modules via the checker.
  - NEW: `@typesugar/core` exports `registerSyntaxMarkerFallback`/
    `getSyntaxMarkerFallback` — a small, provider-declared registry that lets a
    package register "this exact import specifier activates operator/method
    syntax for typeclass X" without needing real module resolution.
    `scanImportsForScope` consults it as a purely additive fallback alongside
    the existing checker-based marker discovery.
  - NEW: `@typesugar/std` registers all 21 of its syntax markers (13 method +
    8 operator) via this mechanism from its `./macros` entry; `@typesugar/fp`
    registers its one marker (`@typesugar/fp/syntax/show`) from its root `.`
    entry (fp has no separate `./macros` compile-time entry).
  - FIXED: `@typesugar/playground`'s `transform()` — the actual in-memory host
    this wave exists for — never loaded std's or fp's compile-time
    registrations at all (both were only imported for runtime values via a
    separate iframe-sandbox bundle). A playground snippet importing e.g.
    `@typesugar/std/syntax/eq/ops` could not activate Eq operator syntax.
    Fixed with two side-effect imports; verified negligible bundle-size impact.
