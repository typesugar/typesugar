# @typesugar/contracts

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d8f810b: PEP-052 Wave 2: labeled-block macros are now import-scoped (`@syntax-labels`
  activation), matching the operator/method syntax gates.
  - BREAKING (pre-1.0): `let:`/`seq:`/`par:`/`all:` do-notation comprehensions
    only expand in files that import `@typesugar/std/syntax/do`, and bare
    `requires:`/`ensures:` contract blocks only apply `@contract` in files that
    import `@typesugar/contracts/syntax`. The explicit `@contract` decorator form
    is unaffected (importing the symbol is the opt-in).
  - NEW: TS9224 warning when a block-shaped label matches a registered macro
    whose syntax is not activated, with a help hint naming the exact import to
    add (unexpanded do-notation is still valid JS — `x << effect()` silently
    becomes a bit-shift — so the hint matters).
  - NEW: `@syntax-labels <macroName>` activation-marker tag (read alongside
    `@syntax-operators`/`@syntax-methods`) and an optional `syntaxModule` field
    on `LabeledBlockMacro`/`AttributeMacro` that feeds the TS9224 hint and
    doubles as a resolution-free activation fallback — an import specifier
    exactly matching a macro's `syntaxModule` activates it even in hosts that
    cannot resolve modules (the playground's in-memory host, virtual file
    names).
  - FIXED: ordinary loop labels colliding with macro label names
    (`all: for (…)`) were dispatched to the macro (a hard error) when the file
    had the syntax activated; labeled non-blocks are no longer dispatch
    candidates at all.
  - FIXED: an expression-position comprehension in a file that never activates
    do-notation was text-rewritten by the preprocessor and then left mangled
    (invalid JS) by the gate; the preprocessor is now gated on activation too,
    leaving such files untouched.
  - FIXED: activation markers (all kinds, operators/methods included) were
    silently dropped in files rewritten by the expression-comprehension
    preprocessor — the re-parsed file isn't part of the `ts.Program`, so
    checker-based marker resolution failed. Markers now resolve against the
    program's own copy of the file.
