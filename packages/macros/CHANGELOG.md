# @typesugar/macros

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 63bf193: PEP-052 Wave 3: do-notation instance resolution is scope-based — the last
  process-global instance registry is deleted.
  - BREAKING (pre-1.0): `let:`/`par:` comprehensions resolve their
    `FlatMap`/`ParCombine` instance from the file's scope (a local `@impl`
    declaration or an export of any imported module), not from a global
    registry populated by side-effect imports elsewhere in the program. The
    std builtins (Array, Promise, Iterable, AsyncIterable) ride along with the
    `@typesugar/std/syntax/do` marker every do-notation file already imports —
    zero new imports for the common case. Effect users import
    `@typesugar/effect/syntax/do` (one line: activates the labels AND provides
    the Effect instances).
  - NEW: TS9225 "No FlatMap instance for 'X' is in scope" error naming the
    exact import to add when resolution misses.
  - NEW: `@do-methods` JSDoc metadata on instances declares do-notation
    emission (bind/map/orElse method names, static-vs-method call style,
    static receiver, `all` join) — replacing the hardcoded Promise/Effect
    special cases in the comprehension macros. Third-party monads get the
    same treatment as std's.
  - NEW: scanner-visible `FlatMap<Either>` instance (`flatMapEitherInstance`)
    in `@typesugar/fp` — `let:` over Either now works via any fp import (the
    `flatMapEither<E>()` factory alone was never discoverable, so Either
    do-notation had silently never expanded).
  - NEW: `ParCombine<Effect>` instance — `par:` over Effect now emits
    `Effect.map(Effect.all([...]), ...)`; previously it fell back to an
    applicative chain emitting `.map(...).ap(...)` calls Effect doesn't have.
  - REMOVED: `doNotationRegistry`, `parCombineBuilderRegistry`, and their API
    (`registerFlatMap`, `registerParCombine`, `registerParCombineBuilder`,
    `getFlatMapMethodNames`, `hasFlatMapInstance`, `hasParCombineInstance`,
    `getInstanceMeta`, `clearRegistries`). Declare instances with `@impl` +
    `@do-methods` and export them instead.

- 98adbea: PEP-052 Wave 4: de-magicking — HKT typeclass knowledge is
  declaration-derived and the dead post-registry surfaces are gone.
  - REMOVED: `hktTypeclassNames`, `registerHKTTypeclass`, the
    `hktExpansionRegistry` hardcoded seeds, and the hand-written HKT signature
    templates. `isHKTTypeclass` now derives from the `@typeclass` interface
    declaration (type parameter used as `Kind<F,…>`, including through
    `extends` chains — the op-index flattens heritage). fp's typeclass
    interfaces (Functor…Alternative) now carry `@typeclass` tags and are read
    exactly like third-party typeclasses.
  - REMOVED: the `InstanceMeta` type, all no-op 1-arg
    `registerInstanceWithMeta` calls, the legacy transformer's import
    pre-scan, the dead `knownTypeclasses` scope chain
    (`isTypeclassInScope`/`getInScopeTypeclasses`/`registerImportedTypeclass`),
    the test-only ResultAlgebra helpers
    (`unsafeResultAlgebra`/`hasResultAlgebra`/`getAllResultAlgebras`), and
    `register-instances.ts` (`registerStdInstances` survives as a deprecated
    runtime no-op stub).
  - NEW: `@do-instance-module <specifier>` JSDoc tag — do-notation instance
    providers self-describe their activation import; the TS9225 hint consults a
    program-wide index first and falls back to a small static table only for
    providers whose declaration files are unreachable in the program.

- 053978c: PEP-053 Wave 1: specialization is now an always-on compiler optimization, not
  an API.
  - REMOVED: the `specialize()`, `specialize$()`, `mono()`, and `inlineCall()`
    macros and runtime stubs, the `fn.specialize(dict)` extension-method rewrite,
    and the `@typesugar/specialize` package (including the `Specialized<F, N>`
    type). Calls that pass a known typeclass instance auto-specialize — no
    annotation needed; use `// @no-specialize` to opt a call out.
  - REMOVED: `createSpecializedFunction`, `canFlattenToExpression`, and the
    `SpecializeOptions` type from `@typesugar/macros` (dead once the explicit
    surface was gone), and the TS9601/TS9221 diagnostics.
  - FIXED: `// @no-specialize-warn` previously disabled specialization entirely
    (substring collision with `// @no-specialize`); it now only suppresses the
    TS9602 skip warning. Both markers now also work on a comment line
    immediately above the call, matching the documented form.

- 8aaf40f: PEP-053 Wave 2: source-based instance extraction now covers everything the
  static builtin table covered. Auto-specialization recognizes instances across
  import aliases (including renames), identifier-alias consts
  (`const stdFlatMapArray = flatMapArray`), zero-arg factory instances
  (`eitherFunctor<E>()`), indirect object-literal members
  (`map: optionFunctor.map`, shorthand `{ map }`), and companion paths
  (`Point.Numeric`). Acceptance criteria are unified across both pipelines:
  an `@impl`/`@instance` tag OR a typeclass-shaped type annotation suffices.

  Cross-module method bodies that reference the instance module's local helpers
  or imports are NOT inlined — those calls fall back to dictionary passing
  (always correct) instead of capturing dangling identifiers.

  The extraction implementation is now shared (`@typesugar/macros`
  instance-extraction module) and consumed by both the legacy transformer and
  transformer-core, replacing the duplicated per-pipeline copies. New
  `cloneNodeDeep` utility in `@typesugar/core` protects foreign-file ASTs from
  in-place position stripping during inlining.

- 76672a0: PEP-053 Waves 4–5: the compiler's hard-coded builtin instance table is gone.
  The ~28 static `registerInstanceMethods(...)` registrations (source-code-as-
  strings copies of the fp/std/effect instances), the deprecated
  `registerInstanceMethods` function, and the internal-registration machinery
  are deleted from `@typesugar/macros`. Instance method bodies now come
  exclusively from source extraction — the same rules for std/fp/effect
  instances as for user instances, no builtin magic. The 16 primitive
  intrinsics (`eqNumber` → `a === b`, …) and the per-program AST registry
  (`registerInstanceMethodsFromAST`) remain. `eitherBifunctor` and
  `flatMapStream` (registrations with no corresponding source instance) are
  dropped. Residual `specialize()`-as-API comment mentions in std/effect/
  collections/validate sources are rewritten for the always-on model.
- c56886c: PEP-054: Rename "SFINAE rules" to "diagnostic suppression rules"

  "SFINAE" borrowed C++ template-metaprogramming terminology (overload-resolution
  failure) for a mechanism that actually suppresses a TypeScript diagnostic when
  typesugar's macro transformer will resolve it at emit time — an unrelated,
  misleading analogy. Renamed throughout to `DiagnosticSuppressionRule` and its
  family.
  - **`@typesugar/core`** (breaking): `packages/core/src/sfinae.ts` and
    `sfinae-rules.ts` are renamed to `diagnostic-suppression.ts` and
    `diagnostic-suppression-rules.ts`. Every exported symbol is renamed:
    `SfinaeRule` → `DiagnosticSuppressionRule`, `SfinaeAuditEntry` →
    `DiagnosticSuppressionAuditEntry`, `SfinaeEvalResult` →
    `DiagnosticSuppressionEvalResult`, `registerSfinaeRule(Once)` →
    `registerDiagnosticSuppressionRule(Once)`, `clearSfinaeRules` →
    `clearDiagnosticSuppressionRules`, `getSfinaeRules` →
    `getDiagnosticSuppressionRules`, `getSfinaeAuditLog`/`clearSfinaeAuditLog` →
    `getDiagnosticSuppressionAuditLog`/`clearDiagnosticSuppressionAuditLog`,
    `isSfinaeAuditEnabled`/`setSfinaeAuditMode` →
    `isDiagnosticSuppressionAuditEnabled`/`setDiagnosticSuppressionAuditMode`,
    `evaluateSfinae` → `evaluateDiagnosticSuppression`. No deprecated aliases
    (pre-1.0, matching PEP-053's precedent). The `TYPESUGAR_SHOW_SFINAE`
    environment variable is renamed to `TYPESUGAR_SHOW_SUPPRESSED_DIAGNOSTICS`.
  - **`@typesugar/macros`** (breaking): `sfinae-rules.ts`/`sfinae-registration.ts`
    renamed to `diagnostic-suppression-rules.ts`/`diagnostic-suppression-registration.ts`.
    `SfinaeRegistrationOptions` → `DiagnosticSuppressionRegistrationOptions`,
    `registerAllSfinaeRules` → `registerAllDiagnosticSuppressionRules`,
    `ALL_SFINAE_RULE_NAMES` → `ALL_DIAGNOSTIC_SUPPRESSION_RULE_NAMES`. Individual
    rule creator functions (`createExtensionMethodCallRule`, etc.) are unchanged.
  - **`@typesugar/transformer`** (breaking, CLI): the `--show-sfinae` flag is
    renamed to `--show-suppressed-diagnostics`. No deprecated alias — the old
    flag is now silently ignored (typesugar's CLI does not error on unrecognized
    flags), so scripts/CI invocations using the old name will stop enabling
    audit mode without a warning. Update any tooling that passes `--show-sfinae`
    or reads `TYPESUGAR_SHOW_SFINAE`.
  - **`@typesugar/lsp-server`, `@typesugar/playground`**: internal call sites
    updated to the renamed core/macros exports; no public API changes.

  Not renamed (deliberately out of scope, see PEP-054): `type-rewrite-registry.ts`
  (a separate, correctly-named mechanism), and PEP-011/PEP-034's own historical
  titles.

### Patch Changes

- 4f6ad83: PEP-034: Unified SFINAE registration and shared IDE infrastructure
  - Unified all SFINAE rule registration into `registerAllSfinaeRules()` to prevent drift between IDE paths
  - New `@typesugar/lsp-common` package with shared position mapping, AST helpers, and macro code actions
  - Added `getApplicableRefactors` and `getCompletionEntryDetails` to the TS plugin language service
  - Diagnostic parity test suite exercising all 6 SFINAE rules
  - Zed extension workspace detection (only starts LSP for typesugar projects)

- 928566a: PEP-049 Wave 4 (test debt):
  - `@typesugar/std`: rename the boolean extension `then(b, fn)` → `andThen(b, fn)`
    (and the matching `Boolean` global augmentation). A top-level ESM export named
    `then` makes the module namespace a thenable, so `await import()` of
    `extensions/boolean` rejected with `undefined` — the module was effectively
    un-dynamically-importable. Use `b.andThen(() => …)` for the lazy
    conditional; `thenSome`/`elseSome`/`fold` are unchanged.
  - `@typesugar/macros`: fix `@hkt` `_` detection inside object type literals.
    `type ObjF = { value: _ }` is now correctly recognized as Tier 3 and expands
    to `this["__kind__"]` (previously the `_` inside a `TypeLiteral`
    `PropertySignature` was skipped and the alias mis-classified as Tier 2).

- 48b621b: PEP-052 Wave 5: `Show` method-sugar activation, and a latent
  `resolveTypeString` bug fix.
  - NEW: `Show`'s interface now carries `@typeclass`, and a new
    `@typesugar/fp/syntax/show` marker (`@syntax-methods Show`) activates
    `.show()` method sugar — mirroring how Eq/Ord's method syntax is gated.
    `Show` has no operator form, so there is only one activation tier.
  - FIXED: `resolveTypeString` (used by the instance scanner to resolve
    `@impl <TC><Type>` type strings) silently resolved the `symbol`/`unknown`/
    `object` keyword types to `any` on some `ts.TypeChecker` configurations
    (an unbound synthetic node quirk), which — because `any` is bidirectionally
    assignable to/from everything — could make two unrelated instances
    (e.g. `@impl Show<symbol>` and `@impl Show<number>`) spuriously report as
    "ambiguous" for every other type. Every keyword type string now resolves
    through the checker's internal intrinsic getter (`getESSymbolType`,
    `getUnknownType`, `getNonPrimitiveType`, etc.) instead of an unbound
    synthetic node, and the fallback path is hardened so any keyword resolving
    to `any` (other than `any` itself) is treated as unresolvable rather than
    silently wrong.
  - FIXED: `@typesugar/fp`'s `package.json` had `"sideEffects": false`, which
    could let an aggressive bundler drop the new marker's bare side-effect
    import. Flipped to `true`, matching `@typesugar/std`'s existing markers.

- 57d76a1: PEP-052 Wave 7: primitive typeclass intrinsics (`eqNumber.equals` → `===`,
  etc.) are no longer hand-written source strings — they're reflected from
  `primitives.ts`'s real, live implementations, so the two can never drift
  apart again.
  - FIXED: two real bugs found while auditing the hand-written strings against
    `primitives.ts`'s actual bodies. `showString.show` used an unescaped
    template literal instead of `JSON.stringify`, producing broken output for
    any string containing a quote or backslash. `ordString.compare` used
    `.localeCompare`, which is locale/ICU-dependent and non-deterministic
    across environments, instead of a plain lexicographic comparison.
  - CHANGED: `hashNumber`/`hashBigint` no longer inline to a crude stand-in
    (`a | 0`, a lossy bitmask) at compile time — their real implementations
    (NaN/Infinity-aware, guaranteed-unsigned hashes) call another primitive as
    a helper, which is only safe at runtime, not when inlined verbatim into a
    caller that doesn't have that helper in scope; a registration-time safety
    check now correctly declines to inline these, falling through to a real
    function call instead. `hashString` (self-contained) still inlines-eligible
    at registration but isn't inlined either, for the orthogonal reason its
    loop body is too complex for the existing inlining pass. Runtime behavior
    when not inlined was already correct; only the compile-time inlining
    optimization for these is affected.
  - REMOVED: `DictMethod.source` and `inlineMethod`'s string-parsing fallback
    — every registered method is now a real AST node.

- ab72bde: PEP-058 Wave 1: declare `engines.node >=20` on all published packages and enable npm provenance attestations in the release pipeline.
- 2fb4b62: Fix: `summonAll` is now importable. It is a registered macro that declares
  `module: "typesugar"` and is documented as public API, but it shipped with no
  runtime stub and no facade export — so `import { summonAll } from "typesugar"`
  failed to type-check and the feature was unusable.
