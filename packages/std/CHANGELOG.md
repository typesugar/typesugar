# @typesugar/std

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d8f810b: PEP-052 Wave 2: labeled-block macros are now import-scoped (`@syntax-labels`
  activation), matching the operator/method syntax gates.
  - BREAKING (pre-1.0): `let:`/`seq:`/`par:`/`all:` do-notation comprehensions
    only expand in files that import `@typesugar/std/syntax/do`, and bare
    `requires:`/`ensures:` contract blocks only apply `@contract` in files that
    import `@typesugar/contracts/syntax`. The explicit `@contract` decorator form
    is unaffected (importing the symbol is the opt-in).
  - NEW: TS9224 warning when a block-shaped label matches a registered macro
    whose syntax is not activated, with a help hint naming the exact import to
    add (unexpanded do-notation is still valid JS — `x << effect()` silently
    becomes a bit-shift — so the hint matters).
  - NEW: `@syntax-labels <macroName>` activation-marker tag (read alongside
    `@syntax-operators`/`@syntax-methods`) and an optional `syntaxModule` field
    on `LabeledBlockMacro`/`AttributeMacro` that feeds the TS9224 hint and
    doubles as a resolution-free activation fallback — an import specifier
    exactly matching a macro's `syntaxModule` activates it even in hosts that
    cannot resolve modules (the playground's in-memory host, virtual file
    names).
  - FIXED: ordinary loop labels colliding with macro label names
    (`all: for (…)`) were dispatched to the macro (a hard error) when the file
    had the syntax activated; labeled non-blocks are no longer dispatch
    candidates at all.
  - FIXED: an expression-position comprehension in a file that never activates
    do-notation was text-rewritten by the preprocessor and then left mangled
    (invalid JS) by the gate; the preprocessor is now gated on activation too,
    leaving such files untouched.
  - FIXED: activation markers (all kinds, operators/methods included) were
    silently dropped in files rewritten by the expression-comprehension
    preprocessor — the re-parsed file isn't part of the `ts.Program`, so
    checker-based marker resolution failed. Markers now resolve against the
    program's own copy of the file.

- 63bf193: PEP-052 Wave 3: do-notation instance resolution is scope-based — the last
  process-global instance registry is deleted.
  - BREAKING (pre-1.0): `let:`/`par:` comprehensions resolve their
    `FlatMap`/`ParCombine` instance from the file's scope (a local `@impl`
    declaration or an export of any imported module), not from a global
    registry populated by side-effect imports elsewhere in the program. The
    std builtins (Array, Promise, Iterable, AsyncIterable) ride along with the
    `@typesugar/std/syntax/do` marker every do-notation file already imports —
    zero new imports for the common case. Effect users import
    `@typesugar/effect/syntax/do` (one line: activates the labels AND provides
    the Effect instances).
  - NEW: TS9225 "No FlatMap instance for 'X' is in scope" error naming the
    exact import to add when resolution misses.
  - NEW: `@do-methods` JSDoc metadata on instances declares do-notation
    emission (bind/map/orElse method names, static-vs-method call style,
    static receiver, `all` join) — replacing the hardcoded Promise/Effect
    special cases in the comprehension macros. Third-party monads get the
    same treatment as std's.
  - NEW: scanner-visible `FlatMap<Either>` instance (`flatMapEitherInstance`)
    in `@typesugar/fp` — `let:` over Either now works via any fp import (the
    `flatMapEither<E>()` factory alone was never discoverable, so Either
    do-notation had silently never expanded).
  - NEW: `ParCombine<Effect>` instance — `par:` over Effect now emits
    `Effect.map(Effect.all([...]), ...)`; previously it fell back to an
    applicative chain emitting `.map(...).ap(...)` calls Effect doesn't have.
  - REMOVED: `doNotationRegistry`, `parCombineBuilderRegistry`, and their API
    (`registerFlatMap`, `registerParCombine`, `registerParCombineBuilder`,
    `getFlatMapMethodNames`, `hasFlatMapInstance`, `hasParCombineInstance`,
    `getInstanceMeta`, `clearRegistries`). Declare instances with `@impl` +
    `@do-methods` and export them instead.

### Patch Changes

- 928566a: PEP-049 Wave 4 (test debt):
  - `@typesugar/std`: rename the boolean extension `then(b, fn)` → `andThen(b, fn)`
    (and the matching `Boolean` global augmentation). A top-level ESM export named
    `then` makes the module namespace a thenable, so `await import()` of
    `extensions/boolean` rejected with `undefined` — the module was effectively
    un-dynamically-importable. Use `b.andThen(() => …)` for the lazy
    conditional; `thenSome`/`elseSome`/`fold` are unchanged.
  - `@typesugar/macros`: fix `@hkt` `_` detection inside object type literals.
    `type ObjF = { value: _ }` is now correctly recognized as Tier 3 and expands
    to `this["__kind__"]` (previously the `_` inside a `TypeLiteral`
    `PropertySignature` was skipped and the alias mis-classified as Tier 2).

- 98adbea: PEP-052 Wave 4: de-magicking — HKT typeclass knowledge is
  declaration-derived and the dead post-registry surfaces are gone.
  - REMOVED: `hktTypeclassNames`, `registerHKTTypeclass`, the
    `hktExpansionRegistry` hardcoded seeds, and the hand-written HKT signature
    templates. `isHKTTypeclass` now derives from the `@typeclass` interface
    declaration (type parameter used as `Kind<F,…>`, including through
    `extends` chains — the op-index flattens heritage). fp's typeclass
    interfaces (Functor…Alternative) now carry `@typeclass` tags and are read
    exactly like third-party typeclasses.
  - REMOVED: the `InstanceMeta` type, all no-op 1-arg
    `registerInstanceWithMeta` calls, the legacy transformer's import
    pre-scan, the dead `knownTypeclasses` scope chain
    (`isTypeclassInScope`/`getInScopeTypeclasses`/`registerImportedTypeclass`),
    the test-only ResultAlgebra helpers
    (`unsafeResultAlgebra`/`hasResultAlgebra`/`getAllResultAlgebras`), and
    `register-instances.ts` (`registerStdInstances` survives as a deprecated
    runtime no-op stub).
  - NEW: `@do-instance-module <specifier>` JSDoc tag — do-notation instance
    providers self-describe their activation import; the TS9225 hint consults a
    program-wide index first and falls back to a small static table only for
    providers whose declaration files are unreachable in the program.

- 563e46b: PEP-052 Wave 6: resolution-free operator/method syntax-marker fallback,
  closing the gap for hosts (the browser playground) that cannot resolve
  modules via the checker.
  - NEW: `@typesugar/core` exports `registerSyntaxMarkerFallback`/
    `getSyntaxMarkerFallback` — a small, provider-declared registry that lets a
    package register "this exact import specifier activates operator/method
    syntax for typeclass X" without needing real module resolution.
    `scanImportsForScope` consults it as a purely additive fallback alongside
    the existing checker-based marker discovery.
  - NEW: `@typesugar/std` registers all 21 of its syntax markers (13 method +
    8 operator) via this mechanism from its `./macros` entry; `@typesugar/fp`
    registers its one marker (`@typesugar/fp/syntax/show`) from its root `.`
    entry (fp has no separate `./macros` compile-time entry).
  - FIXED: `@typesugar/playground`'s `transform()` — the actual in-memory host
    this wave exists for — never loaded std's or fp's compile-time
    registrations at all (both were only imported for runtime values via a
    separate iframe-sandbox bundle). A playground snippet importing e.g.
    `@typesugar/std/syntax/eq/ops` could not activate Eq operator syntax.
    Fixed with two side-effect imports; verified negligible bundle-size impact.

- 76672a0: PEP-053 Waves 4–5: the compiler's hard-coded builtin instance table is gone.
  The ~28 static `registerInstanceMethods(...)` registrations (source-code-as-
  strings copies of the fp/std/effect instances), the deprecated
  `registerInstanceMethods` function, and the internal-registration machinery
  are deleted from `@typesugar/macros`. Instance method bodies now come
  exclusively from source extraction — the same rules for std/fp/effect
  instances as for user instances, no builtin magic. The 16 primitive
  intrinsics (`eqNumber` → `a === b`, …) and the per-program AST registry
  (`registerInstanceMethodsFromAST`) remain. `eitherBifunctor` and
  `flatMapStream` (registrations with no corresponding source instance) are
  dropped. Residual `specialize()`-as-API comment mentions in std/effect/
  collections/validate sources are rewritten for the always-on model.
- ab72bde: PEP-058 Wave 1: declare `engines.node >=20` on all published packages and enable npm provenance attestations in the release pipeline.
